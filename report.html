        <h1>Report</h1>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>For Project 1, I decided to make a website for my sister. She wants to have an online shop one day and is
            currently using a reselling app to sell her clothes which takes commission and so by having her own site,
            she would get to keep all the profit. This prototype, once fully implemented to more than
            just 5 html pages, could become a useable store interface for her to use.</p>
        <h3>Functional Project Pages</h3>
        <p>There are five functional pages:
        <ol>
            <li>Welcome/Home Page</li>
            <li>Create an Account Page</li>
            <li>Tops & Tees Page</li>
            <li>Shopping Cart Page</li>
            <li>FAQs Page</li>
        </ol>
        All other links are set to the default "#".
        </p>
        <h3>Content</h3>
        <p>The content in my Project 1 is original with photos and text from my sister and myself. The only photo not
            from us is the one on the home page which is from unsplash. The code I used was mainly written by myself,
            but with some help from previous labs and lectures. Any code taken from those have been altered in this
            project. There are form elements (inputs and checkboxes) on the Create an Account page. The site does
            include links to other pages that I created, but not other outside sites. There are the five required pages.
            There is no favicon at the moment so that error does appear in the developer tools. The pages do have some
            animation (transformations like on the tops/tees page). There is a report.html (this page).</p>
        <h3>Coherence and Contrast</h3>
        <p>The images are appropriate to the theme as this is a clothing site and I've only used clothing images. The
            images are appropriately sized for desktop. There is strong alignment from the use of grid and flex boxes.
            My style is maintained across pages. The spacing is mostly clean, but could be cleaner on some pages. The
            site does include a different font from google fonts.</p>
        <h3>Client-mindedness</h3>
        <p>The site was designed with the client in mind. I sent my sketches of options of what I was able to gather
            from my clients needs back to my client for them to decide which they liked best for the site. My site
            doesn't appear appropriately on mobile at the moment. It appears well on desktop though. My site is arranged
            in a navigable way. There is a top/global navigation to go from page to page. Clicking on the logo or shop
            name will bring you back to the home page. All images have been made accessible with alt attributes.</p>
        <h3>Client-mindedness</h3>
        <p>There is external CSS files used and they're stored in the CSS folder. I didn't add any style tags in the
            html files. Instead, I made external CSS sheets for each page. I also have a JS folder to hold any .js files
            I wrote and an images folder to hold all the images used on the site. The site is served over HTTPS and does
            redirect from port 80 to port 443. The HTML, CSS, and JS are readable as I tried to add comments and logical
            id/class tags. My files do pass all validation. The site was created without the aid of other libraries or
            frameworks. There was not a steady flow of commits to Git.</p>
