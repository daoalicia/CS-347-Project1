        <h2>Orders & Shipping</h2>
        <h3>How much is shipping?</h3>
        <p>Shipping in the United States is $7 for any orders under $50. Free standard shipping is applied to orders
            $50+.</p>
        <h3>Where do you ship?</h3>
        <p>We ship to the United States and Canada. Unfortunately, we do not offer any other international shipping at
            the moment. We are currently working on figuring this out to appeal to more consumers.</p>
        <h3>When will my order arrive?</h3>
        <p>Orders will take 1-3 business days to be processed and shipped. Shipping to the United States should take
            about 2-3 business days. Shipping to Canada can take up to 7 business days due to customs.</p>
        <h3>Can I make changes to my order after it's been placed?</h3>
        <p>If your order has not been marked as shipped yet, you may stil make changes to your order. Please contact us
            and our team will ensure your changes are made.</p>

        <br>
        <h2>Returns & Exchanges</h2>
        <h3>What is your return policy?</h3>
        <p>Returns in the United States are accepted within 14 days of delivery. Please make sure all tags are still on
            if you plan to return. Return shipping will be covered by the buyer. Unfortunately, we do not accept returns
            from Canada.</p>
        <h3>When will I get my refund?</h3>
        <p>Once we receive your return package, you will receive an email stating your total refund and should expect to
            see it in your statements within 1-5 business days.</p>

        <br>
        <h2>Rewards</h2>
        <p>We do not have a rewards program at the moment, but we are currently working on one. Please send any
            suggestions to our customer service team!</p>
